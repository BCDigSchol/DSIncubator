# Preliminary reflection

## Prompt

To kick off your participation in the incubator, we ask you to reflect upon the goals of the project you hope to more fully develop during our time together. Some questions to guide your thinking include:

- What do I think I’m doing? How do I currently conceptualize goals for this project? What do I think I’m creating? What are its components? Do these ideas seem adequate? Would I rather be doing something else? What? Why?
- What are my fundamental assumptions? What values am I bringing to this project, and how do I see those values affecting my ideas? Is that a problem? What are my feelings toward this project? Is it cool? Challenging? Kind of stupid? Why?
- What do I think I know? What’s my current plan? For example, do I know what my subject area is? Have I already gotten a sense of what types of content would be accessible through or operated upon in my project? How I would describe and arrange them? What my audience thinks and wants, and how I respond to that? What has led me to this point? What would change my mind?
- What do I think I don’t know? Where am I totally confused? What do I need to learn to proceed? For example, do I need to do some subject research? Do I need to think more about how my project would actually be used?
- What would I rather not think about? Would I be happy to ignore the audience? Would I rather have my audience tell me what to do? What seems like a black hole? Why? Where would clarity come from?
- What seems like a barrier? What are project constraints? Are they really constraints? Am I secretly glad of certain limitations? What kinds of questions should I keep asking myself each week as I work on this?
- Where do I go next?
- What am I aiming for? What would a successful project look like? What would a failed project look like?

## Where to submit

We ask that you submit your written reflection (perhaps around 500 words) to our cohort's Google Group at digital-incubator-ggroup@bc.edu. With your permission, we will post your reflection on the the Boston College Libraries' [digital scholarship blog](https://ds.bc.edu/blog) in the [Incubator](https://ds.bc.edu/category/incubator) category.

## Credit where credit is due

This list of questions re-uses those from the [Making the Humanities Digital](https://aeshin.org/teaching/inls-890-186/2012/fa) course taught by Ryan Shaw in Fall 2012 at the [UNC-Chapel Hill School of Library and Information Science](https://sils.unc.edu). Shaw, in turn, lightly adapted this course design from [Melanie Feinberg](https://ils.unc.edu/~mfeinber).
