Questions that might inform preliminary reflection, taken from [DH course taught by Ryan Shaw](https://aeshin.org/teaching/inls-890-186/2012/fa/assignments/) and adapted from curriculum designed by [Melanie Feinberg](https://ils.unc.edu/~mfeinber/).

* What do I think I’m doing? 
* How do I currently conceptualize goals for this project? 
* What do I think I’m creating? What are its components? 
* Do these ideas seem adequate? Would I rather be doing something else? What? Why?
* What are my fundamental assumptions? What values am I bringing to this project, and how do I see those values affecting my ideas? Is that a problem? What are my feelings toward this project? Is it cool? Challenging? Kind of stupid? Why?
* What do I think I know? What’s my current plan? For example, do I know what my subject area is? Have I already gotten a sense of what types of content would be accessible through or operated upon in my project? How I would describe and arrange them? What my audience thinks and wants, and how I respond to that? What has led me to this point? What would change my mind?
* What do I think I don’t know? Where am I totally confused? What do I need to learn to proceed? For example, do I need to do some subject research? Do I need to think more about how my project would actually be used?
* What would I rather not think about? Would I be happy to ignore the audience? Would I rather have my audience tell me what to do? What seems like a black hole? Why? Where would clarity come from?
* What seems like a barrier? What are project constraints? Are they really constraints? Am I secretly glad of certain limitations? What kinds of questions should I keep asking myself each week as I work on this?
* Where do I go next?
* What am I aiming for? What would a successful project look like? What would a failed project look like?
