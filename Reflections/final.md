# Final reflection

## Prompt

To conclude your participation in the incubator, we ask you to reflect upon the goals of the project you hope to more fully develop during our time together. Some questions to guide your thinking include:

- What does it mean to “design” a “digital humanities project”? How does this activity differ (or not differ) from
traditional forms of humanities scholarship, and
traditional ways in which libraries, archives, and museums provide access to their materials?
- How are the goals of an designer and those of an audience or community of users to be negotiated in the design of a digital humanities project? How does the designer acknowledge and facilitate the will and power of the audience while also advocating for a particular way of seeing or doing things?
- How should digital humanities projects be critiqued or evaluated? How can such an evaluation can be made rigorous and systematic?

In your essay, feel free to draw upon your experiences developing your project and/or any critical reading you've done during our time together.

## Where to submit

Please submit your written reflection (perhaps around 500 words) to our cohort's Google Group at spring-2019-digital-scholarship-incubator@googlegroups.com. With your permission, we will post your reflection on the the Boston College Libraries' [digital scholarship blog](https://ds.bc.edu/blog).

## Credit where credit is due

This list of questions re-uses those from the [Making the Humanities Digital](https://aeshin.org/teaching/inls-890-186/2012/fa) course taught by Ryan Shaw in Fall 2012 at the [UNC-Chapel Hill School of Library and Information Science](https://sils.unc.edu). Shaw, in turn, lightly adapted this course design from [Melanie Feinberg](https://ils.unc.edu/~mfeinber).
