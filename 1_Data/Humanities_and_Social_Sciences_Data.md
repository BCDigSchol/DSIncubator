# Humanities and Social Sciences Data

## Reflections on Reflections



## Discussion

1. What do we mean when we say “data”?
2. What are examples of humanities and social science data?
3. What kinds of data do you work with?
4. Do you have ways that you currently clean or pre-process data?

## Project Critique

Go to [project examples and critique section](https://github.com/BCDigSchol/DSIncubator/blob/master/1_Data/project-critique.md).

## Draw Your Data!

Push away the computer and pick up some old-school tools:
- colored markers or pencils
- lots of blank paper or white boards
- your imagination

First, at the top of your sketching space, write down your data story.
- Is it in the form of a question? If so, figure out how to pose the question.
- Or maybe it's in the form of an answer to that question? If so, spell out your clearest statement.
- If you're lucky, perhaps you already can envision a full story, with a beginning, middle, and end.
- Whatever form it takes in your head, write out the words that come to mind.

Further down your sketching space, draw quick pictures of the visualizations that comes to your mind, even if you don't yet have any data. No artistic skills are required. Just use your imagination.
- Do you envision some type of chart? Sketch a picture.
- Or do you imagine some type of map? Show what it might look like.
- Will your visualization be interactive? Insert arrows, buttons, whatever.

Finally, share your data story with someone else and talk through your preliminary ideas. Does your sketch and sentences help to convey the broader idea that you're trying to communicate?
