# Humanities and Social Sciences Data

## Reflections on Reflections

This week we asked you to submit a [preliminary reflection](../Reflections/preliminary.md) on the goals of the project you hope to develop over the course of the incubator.

- Did anything surprising come out of the process of writing your reflection?
- Several of you chose to write about the affective experience of developing a digital scholarship project. Are you itching to get started? A bit apprehensive? Why?
- One of the things that's so hard about developing digital scholarship projects from scratch is that we don't always have a clear idea of our end result. But sometimes it's easier to say how we'd know we were successful than it is to say what our end result will be. How will you know if your project succeeds?
- What's next for you? Will you be seeking new information, new collaborators?
- As you're starting to get a clearer idea of where you want to be by the end of the Incubator, let us know how can we help. Our curriculum includes overviews of specific methodologies, as well as mile markers for developing your project plan. Is there anything currently missing from the Incubator that would help you to get where you want to go?

## Discussion

1. What do we mean when we say “data”?
2. What are examples of humanities and social science data?
3. What kinds of data do you work with?
4. Do you have ways that you currently clean or pre-process data?

## Project Critique

Go to [project examples and critique section](../1_Data/project-critique.md).

## Draw Your Data!

When you're getting ready to develop a project, it's tempting to leap ahead to picking out what tools or software you're going to use. Instead, let's take a moment to think about your raw materials (your data) and the story you'll tell using those materials.

Push away the computer and pick up some old-school tools:
- colored markers or pencils
- lots of blank paper or white boards
- your imagination

First, at the top of your sketching space, write down your data story.
- Is it in the form of a question? If so, figure out how to pose the question.
- Or maybe it's in the form of an answer to that question? If so, spell out your clearest statement.
- If you're lucky, perhaps you already can envision a full story, with a beginning, middle, and end.
- Whatever form it takes in your head, write out the words that come to mind.

Further down your sketching space, draw quick pictures of the visualizations that comes to your mind, even if you don't yet have any data. No artistic skills are required. Just use your imagination.
- Do you envision some type of chart? Sketch a picture.
- Or do you imagine some type of map? Show what it might look like.
- Will your visualization be interactive? Insert arrows, buttons, whatever.

Finally, share your data story with someone else and talk through your preliminary ideas. Does your sketch and sentences help to convey the broader idea that you're trying to communicate?
