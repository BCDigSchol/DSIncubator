# The Crit

A crit, or critique session, draws on fine arts practice, "in which a student's artwork is formally evaluated by a group of faculty and students." Kurt Ralske offers a [long-form explanation](http://retnull.com/index.php?/texts/the-crit/) of "the crit."

## Project reflections (90 minutes)

Five volunteers will reflect upon their project for an audience of their fellow creators. Each round of reflection will follow this structure:

1. Incubator participant presents project, drawing upon both the revised [project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZPn5Imlo_Q7nqHoQovid_zVovF5bbi5n1qcU9GgP39Y/edit?usp=sharing) and the [final reflection](/Reflections/final.md) (5 minutes).
2. Incubator facilitators and other participants ask questions and offer feedback (10–13 minutes).

We ask that these five volunteers send their revised proposal and final reflection, as well as any presentation materials, to digital-incubator-ggroup@bc.edu by Friday, October 27.

## Project elevator pitches (30 minutes)

Every incubator participants will present a 90-second elevator pitch for a broad public audience. To develop your elevator pitch, you may wish to consult [The Art of Pitchcraft](http://about.mjumbepoe.com/elevator-pitch-builder), an interactive elevator pitch builder developed by self-styled urban technologist [Mjumbe Poe](http://about.mjumbepoe.com). You're also welcome to adopt the [Pecha Kucha format](http://www.pechakucha.org/watch) (20 images x 20 seconds)—or any other format—in order to structure and deliver your pitch.

If you are using slides or other presentation materials to accompany your pitch, please send them to digital-incubator-ggroup@bc.edu by Friday, October 27.
