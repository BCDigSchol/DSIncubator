# Text Analysis

## Introduction
This document presents an overview of the workshop, which includes both lecture and hands-on exercises.

## Learning Goals
Participants will:
* Discuss the nature of textuality as it applies to digital texts we use for analysis
* Prepare digital texts we find on the web for ingestion into Voyant Tools
* Learn the capabilities of Voyant’s suite of textual analysis tools, and identify a few of its weaknesses
* Take some first steps into Lexos, a digital textual analysis tool with capabilities different from Voyant

## Workshop Outline
The workshop will consist of a lecture peppered with exercises we’ll perform as a group in Voyant and Lexos. These are outlined in the [session’s slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13dIG0uIZb5P1V_0jHuosPEMVwIYXmYCyha1kjZOOvqI/edit?usp=sharing).
