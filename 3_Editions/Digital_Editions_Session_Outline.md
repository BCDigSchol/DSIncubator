# Session Outline

## Introduction
This document presents an overview of the workshop, which includes both lecture and hands-on exercises.

## Learning Goals
Participants will: 
* Become familiar with the spectrum along which digital critical editions are made
* Identify points of mediation between themselves and digital editions’ texts
* Understand how design impacts digital editions’ functionalities
* Conceptualize the boundaries of the digital edition: i.e., when is it no longer an edition?

## Workshop Outlines
The workshop will consist of four hands-on exercises. Participants will split into four groups, and each group will complete one over the course of twenty to thirty minutes.

**Group 1.** Print v. Digital. Read two or three letters in the supplied print volume of Horace Walpole’s correspondence, then locate and read the same one in the online [Horace Walpole’s Correspondence](http://walpole.library.yale.edu/collections/digital-collections/horace-walpole-correspondence). How do the reading experiences compare? Give us in-depth comments on differences and similarities.

**Group 2.** Design. Identify three changes that could be made to [Darwin Online](http://darwin-online.org.uk/) that would make for better usability.

**Group 3.** Annotation. Browse two or three letters in the digital edition of [Van Gogh’s Letters](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/), focusing on paratext. What different kinds of things are linked in the bodies of the letters? Does the digital environment better suit some kinds of linked material than others?

**Group 4.** Navigation. Spend ten minutes or so exploring [The Casebooks Project](http://www.magicandmedicine.hps.cam.ac.uk/) and report back on your first impressions of navigating the site.
